This is the repository for Creeping Dark III development. The pack is in "alpha", and will probably remain so until our YouTube series is finished. Very little real playtesting has been done, so many bugs are expected.

Those that wish to check out the pack, alpha releases will be uploaded here (in the Releases section on the sidebar on the right), which may be imported into any CurseForge compatible launcher.
