Creeping Dark III is the Minecraft 1.20 continuation of the Creeping Dark series. The premise is basically the same, but the mod selection has changed quite a bit, and the quest mechanics have changed to match.

Right now, CD3 should be considered to be in "alpha" stage. It has had very little playtesting, and is probably still quite buggy.

The more adventurous of you that want to check out the pack can download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/nathanrsfba/creeping-dark-3/releases) page. The releases will be in the form of a `.zip` file that can be imported into any CurseForge-compatible launcher.

This page will be updated as pack development progresses.
